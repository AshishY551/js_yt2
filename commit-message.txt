feat: add JavaScript practice files for math, datetime, and testing

- Added `12numsMaths.js`:
  * Demonstrates core Math operations (round, ceil, floor, random, etc.)
  * Covers number manipulation techniques for practice

- Added `13datetime.js`:
  * Implements Date object usage (current date/time, formatting, extraction of day/month/year)
  * Showcases practical datetime handling

- Added `test.js`:
  * Scratchpad file for running and testing small JavaScript snippets
  * Serves as a utility file for verifying concepts before integration

These additions expand the codebase with fundamental JS practice scripts 
for learning and quick testing.
