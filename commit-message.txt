âž¿ Add while and do...while loop examples (28While.js)

- Introduced **28While.js** under `05Iterators/` to expand iteration concepts.  
- Covered multiple loop variations with practical examples:  

  ðŸ”¹ **While Loop**  
      â€¢ Prints even numbers up to 10 using an incremental counter.  
      â€¢ Iterates through `myarray=['falsh','bat','ball']` using index-based while loop.  

  ðŸ”¹ **Do...While Loop**  
      â€¢ Demonstrates loop execution at least once regardless of condition.  
      â€¢ Example with `score=1` runs until <= 10.  
      â€¢ Example with `score1=11` proves condition check happens after first execution.  

- âœ… Enhances iterator module with conditional and post-condition loop structures.  
- ðŸ“˜ Lecture28 continuation with emphasis on practical usage and control flow.
