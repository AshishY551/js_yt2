"⚙️ Add JS Execution & Call Stack Concepts (25Execute&callstack.js)

- Documented JavaScript Execution Contexts
  • Global Execution Context (window / this reference)
  • Function Execution Context (new variable environment + execution thread)
  • Eval Execution Context (property)

- Explained JS Execution Phases
  • Memory Creation Phase (variables/functions hoisted as undefined/definitions)
  • Execution Phase (assignment & execution flow)

- Added Detailed Example
  • Step-by-step trace of function execution
  • Memory allocation & execution cycle inside sandbox
  • Demonstrated how new execution contexts are created & deleted

- Covered Call Stack Mechanism
  • Illustrated stack LIFO principle with nested function calls
  • Visualized stack frames (Global → one() → two() → three())
  • Added console snippet usage for debugging

✅ Enhances clarity on JS internals  
✅ Includes comments + diagrams for easier understanding  
✅ Ready for learners to trace real execution flow"
