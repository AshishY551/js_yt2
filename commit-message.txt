ðŸ”€ Add switch-case control flow examples (26switchcase.js)

- Implemented switch-case structure for clean conditional branching
- Demonstrated integer-based switch:
  â€¢ Example: month = 3 â†’ outputs 'March'
  â€¢ Explained behavior when `break` is omitted (fall-through execution)
  â€¢ Highlighted execution flow after first match until a break is found

- Added string-based switch example:
  â€¢ Example: month2 = 'march' (case-sensitive check)
  â€¢ Illustrated mismatch due to lowercase vs uppercase ('march' vs 'March')
  â€¢ Default branch handling â†’ outputs 'april'

- Key learnings captured:
  â€¢ `switch` is case-sensitive for string comparisons
  â€¢ Missing `break` executes subsequent cases (fall-through)
  â€¢ `default` acts as fallback when no match is found

âœ… Enhances 04controlFlow module with practical switch-case scenarios  
âœ… Demonstrates both numeric & string-based condition handling  
âœ… Highlights common pitfalls (case sensitivity & missing break)
