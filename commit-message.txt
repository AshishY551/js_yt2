üîÄ Add Control Flow examples with if-else & operators (26ifelse.js)

- Introduced basic control flow structures:
  ‚Ä¢ if, else-if, else statements
  ‚Ä¢ Inline if statements for compact syntax (with caveat on readability)

- Demonstrated key comparison & logical operators:
  ‚Ä¢ <, >, <=, >=, !=
  ‚Ä¢ == vs === (type coercion vs strict equality)
  ‚Ä¢ !== strict inequality check

- Showcased execution flow:
  ‚Ä¢ true/false conditions
  ‚Ä¢ Number vs string comparisons (2 == '2' ‚úÖ / 2 === '2' ‚ùå)
  ‚Ä¢ Logical AND (&&) and OR (||) combinations for login validation

- Explained scope handling:
  ‚Ä¢ let/const block scope (unavailable outside block)
  ‚Ä¢ var function/global scope (accessible outside block ‚Üí unsafe)

- Added practical examples:
  ‚Ä¢ Temperature check (< 50 vs > 50)
  ‚Ä¢ Score & power variable scoping issue
  ‚Ä¢ Balance validation with multiple conditions
  ‚Ä¢ User authentication logic (login + debit card + multiple login methods)

‚úÖ Enhances understanding of JS control flow  
‚úÖ Covers operator differences with clear console outputs  
‚úÖ Highlights best practices (avoid inline one-liners, prefer const/let over var)"
